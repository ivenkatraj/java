# Variables

Variables are used to store values assigned by the developer.

After **ES6**, there are two more variable declaration in JS. They are **let** & **const**

># Best practices for identifier naming
>- The identifier name must be unique and it should not use any pre-defined names of JS. <br/>
>    >✅ var variableName = "Hello World"; <br/>
>   >❌  var const = "Hello World";
>-  The identifier name can be associated with $ and _ signs.<br/>
>       >✅ var $name = "John", _age = 20; <br/>
>       >❌ var *name = "John", %age = 20;
