# What is Java?
  Java is a widely used programming language for its independence from web application to mobile applications. The main characteristics of Java are
  
  -**_Platform Independence_** - means the java code can be run on any operating system from windows, linux based distros and mac. That's why platform independence.
  
  -**_Write Once, Run Anywhere_** - It follows WORA(Write Once, Run Anywhere) philosophy as mentioned in platform independence.

  -**_Multithreading_** - means we can do multitask at the same time in a single page. Eg. in youtube you can watch video, open comments and see other videos by scrolling at the same time.
